# Next Word Predictor using LSTM

This repository contains code and resources for building a next word prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The project aims to create a predictive text system that suggests the most likely word to follow a given sequence of words. This type of technology has a wide range of applications, from text composition assistance to natural language interfaces.

## Features

- **LSTM-Based Model**: Utilizes an LSTM architecture to analyze sequences of words and predict the most likely next word.
- **Customizable Vocabulary**: Allows for training with different text corpora, enabling flexibility in application contexts.
- **Interactive Prediction**: Includes a script for interactive text prediction, allowing users to test the model with custom inputs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- `tensorflow` and `numpy` libraries

## Acknowledgments
Special thanks to the developers of TensorFlow for the LSTM framework and to the contributors who helped make this project possible.
